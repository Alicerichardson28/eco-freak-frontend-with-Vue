      <p class='about-content'>
      We are living in a time of turmoil for the Earth. Species extinction, deforestation, climate change, rising sea levels, <br> 
      and many other problems face the planet we call home. These problems are a result of the way modern society exploits <br> 
      the Earth and her resourcesâ€”the way we relate to the Earth as separate, non-living, and unlimited. I believe that we can <br> 
      transform our relationship to the Earth. Instead of seeing the Earth as outside ourselves, we can see the Earth as our <br>  
      extended body, our home. Perhaps then, we would take care of her the way we would take care of our own body.
